## Execution

Run the following cmd:
    npm install
	npm start
	
	
## Control singal sending 


One can write his own program to send angle via websockt. Angle data (two int16) to be sent should be written into msg_send_posture[8:9] and msg_send_posture[10:11]. Example code:
	var wsUrl = "ws://localhost:9999";

	websocket = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
	var msg_send_posture  =  new Uint8Array([0xAA,  0x01,0x53,  0x01,  0x04,0x00,0x00,0x00,   0x01,0x00, 0x00,0x00,  0x00,0x00,   0x7F];

	websocket.send(msg_send_posture);
